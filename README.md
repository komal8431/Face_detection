# Face_detection
This project uses OpenCV Haar Cascade Classifier to detect and track human faces in images and real-time video. The algorithm is based on Haar wavelet features and uses the integral image concept for fast computation. AdaBoost selects important features from training data to build effecient classifieers.
Tools and Techniques:
Python, OpenCV, Numpy
Haar Cascade Classifier
